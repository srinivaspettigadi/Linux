I want to configure swagger for my application, I have created a docker container below is the config,

version: '3'

services:
  swagger:
    image: swaggerapi/swagger-ui
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    environment:
      - SWAGGER_JSON=/home/bdrkuser/swagger/swagger.json # Mount your Swagger JSON file
    networks:
      - appnet
    deploy:
      replicas: 1 # You usually need only one Swagger UI instance

networks:
  appnet:
  
 
for the line :  - SWAGGER_JSON=/home/bdrkuser/swagger/swagger.json 

I have used the swagger.json file from my existing env just to check if this works, now I am getting the authentication failed, 
since the api for this env which i am going to configure does not get authenticated.

The services which I want to configure is a docker service which is hosted on docker swarm cluster.

Could you please let me know how can we generate a json file for my api calls for the docker service and enable the same on swagger.
