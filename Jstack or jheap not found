Eventhough we have installed/downloaded the files its shows jheap or jstack not found


docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' <paste the container id here>

go to cd /home/ssm-user and then mkdir heap and then cd heap

check pwd u must be in /home/ssm-user/heap

vi download.sh

paste this and save the file

for i in jattach gcore gdb ; do \
      curl -L -o $i https://github.com/pwillis-els/docker-build-static/releases/download/v0.1.0/$i ; \
done
chmod 755 jattach gcore gdb
 
sudo ./jattach <process id which u got in 6th line> dumpheap /tmp/dumpheap-<sameid>.dump

docker cp 8e1f316737c3:/tmp/dumpheap-28780.dump host-dumpheap-28780.dump

docker exec -it <container id> rm /tmp/dumpheap-28780.dump

TRY THIS TO FIX THE ISSUE 

chmod +x jattach
echo $PATH
export PATH=/home/ssm-user/heapjattach:$PATH
source ~/.bashrc
