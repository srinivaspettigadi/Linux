We have been creating all the resources with terraform, but this will create all the resources independently like vpc, subnet etc..

We must have an architecture of which cluster or stack we are going to create and make sure we must share the componenets which are required.

Now currently I have created virtual private gateway and others have created variuos resources, common resources must not be created more than once, and 
also we can create once and use those components in sample.tfvars and pass it to the compoenents which we create.

We have use terraform.tfvars and add all the vpc id and subnets which we need to create the actual/main resource, we have to pass this terraform.tfvars file while apply command

terraform apply --var-file=sample.tfvars

Current approach which we are using will create lot of duplicate resources, please create an architecture and we shall split the componenets which are required to
build the stack.
