Let us replicate all the components/services with the existing one and create in the ohio region. Lets us create the shared resources first and use the same one for 
independent resources.

Shared Resources like : VPC, SUBNET, security group, etc..

Firstly will be creating all the shared resources and will hardcode all the values in config.tfvars, whenever we are creating a new resouce which requires
these shared resouces will be passing the config.tfvars explicitly in the terraform apply command.

Let us not create anything on local as far as state file is concerned, will push all the to the s3 bucket, and use those.

I have created a state file in s3 and created a vpc successfully with defined cidr blocks
