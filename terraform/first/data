Shared resources: the resources which are used for creating other resources like, 
when we create ec2 instance : VPC, subnet, security group are mandate and we wont create each and every time wheneevr we create a 
new instance.

Let us replicate all the components/services with the existing one and create in the ohio region. 
Lets us create the shared resources first and use the same one for independent resources.

Shared Resources like : VPC, SUBNET, security group, etc..

Firstly will be creating all the shared resources and will hardcode all the values in config.tfvars,
whenever we are creating a new resouce which requires these shared resouces will be passing the config.tfvars,
explicitly in the terraform apply command.

Let us not create anything on local as far as state file is concerned, will push all the to the s3 bucket, and use those.

I have created a state file in s3 and created a vpc successfully with defined cidr blocks
